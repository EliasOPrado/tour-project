    Authenticate a User by using a case-insensitive query to check a
    combination of the supplied email/username and password.
    To avoid the risk of having two users with similar usernames,
    distinguished only by letter case (e.g. 'john' and 'John'), consider
    updating your User model to save usernames as lower case entries to
    the database.
    This will ensure all usernames have unique spellings, and as a result,
    our case insensitive query will return a single result only.
